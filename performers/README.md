  where,
  - `id`: is a unique performer id
  - `name`: is the name of the performer

### Tasks

##### Notes
- Do as much as you can. you are not required to finish the project
- Don't worry about styling at all! just basic stuff.
- All libraries you need to finish this task is already included in package.json (including Redux)
- If you don't know redux, you can complete the task in pure react.

##### Main Task
- Render the list of performers on the page (3 cards per row) using React and Redux.
  - Recommended order of execution:
    - If using Redux:
      - 1.a: Create an action `FETCH_PERFORMERS` in actions folder to call the API and get the results.
      - 1.b: Fill out the `reducers/performers.js` reducer to populate the store with the returned array of performers
    - If using pure React:
      - 1. Fetch the list of performers in `componentDidMount()` method of your top component.
    - 2. Create a `components/Performer.js`
    - 3. Create a `components/PerformerList.js` to render and array of `components/Performer.js`.

##### Bonus Task (noone has ever completed this task)
- If you are REALLY REALLY fast, go ahead and do as much of this task as you can.
  - Create a drop-down filter on top of the page with the following options ['all', 'sport', 'music', 'theater']
  - Initially `all` should be selected and all performers should be rendered.
  - Upon changing the drop-down, filter the list of performers that their `category_group` matches the selected value.
